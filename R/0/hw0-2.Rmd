This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
df <- read.csv("/Users/michael/Codes/R/sample/student.csv", sep=";", header=T)

df

df1=data.frame(name=c("Brad Pitt"),id=c("40051"),gpa=("2.21"),grade=c("C"))
rbind(df,df1)
```

df <- read.csv("/Users/michael/Desktop/student.csv", sep=";", header=T)

df

df1=data.frame(name=c("Brad Pitt"),id=c("40051"),gpa=("2.21"),grade=c("C"))
rbind(df,df1)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
